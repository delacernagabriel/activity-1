    <h1>This is my story</h1>
<p>My name is Gabriel Vincent C. Dela Cerna. I am 22 years old and currently living in Cebu City. I have nine siblings, and I am the youngest among them.</p>
 <p>During my younger years, I studied at Alaska Elementary School and graduated in the batch of 2012–2013. I completed my high school education at Alaska Night High School, batch 2021–2022. For Junior High School, I attended Academia Global System Colleges and graduated in the batch of 2024–2025. Currently, I am studying at the University of Cebu.</p> 
 <p>My hobbies include playing mobile games, using the computer, watching movies, and reading manga. I also enjoy traveling to different places with my family and friends.</p> 
 <p>I chose to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) because it offers practical and hands-on learning that prepares students for the real-world demands of the IT industry. This course focuses on high-demand skills such as programming, networking, database management, and cybersecurity—fields that I am very interested in. I believe that mastering these areas will open doors to many career opportunities. I want a degree that will not only educate me but also give me a competitive edge in the job market.</p>
